Sequence analyzer

new thoughts
- two modes:
   - immediate reaction mode, or input mode - do just input and try to ouput smth - optional
   - continuous think mode: after first input completed, dive on topics classifying and making links - like in "dream" - analyzing more that has been input, and in "active" diving on topics requested

- [[associate sequence forms: like text forms - search for similarities in input sequence]]
- strong fuzzy compare algorithm:
    - take a window
    - ... see code
    - optimize by searching most frequent matches first, then go through links and search there
- classification algorithm
- old drop algorithm: if mem runs out...

  - 2d (raster picture) compare

- classify:
  - first part is to link close-standing subseqs
  - then join containing sub-parts into class, when 'search window' grows
  - use weights - and - layers: on "layer 0" analyze connectivity between data sequences, "layer 1" will connect more distant sequences, etc.
  - detect conglomerates and find connections between - in similar manner
    it is very TODO item! how to introduce levels? ever introduce levels???

- use consequences
  - relative and absolute time diff can also be compared and used for similarity matching, if any other connection points to links between [events?]
  - time diff will require more elements to link into event sequence and then to be compared as conglom
- predict??

so we have in one simd:
- time stamp
- sequence
- part of sequence
   - connection of sequence part: L0[1,2,4,5,...], L1, ...
   - belonging to conglomerate #N-L0, #N2-L1, ...


algorithm:

---
- include all possible sequences (?? cheat-introduce some known like sin, x^2, exp, etc..)
- (later) add auto-programming thing to search for algorithm
- use time as always-existing parameter
(see how SETI does this?)
